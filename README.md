The idea to work towards:

You are launched onto a mission to quell the alien infestation. 
The aliens have infested an astroid belt in the system.
So, it is your duty to travel from astroid to astroid destroying 
any hives you find along the way.

You will have to obey each astroids law of gravity, and navigate 
through caverns and passage ways toward the center where you will
combat a boss, and then destroy the astroid to eliminate a hive.
